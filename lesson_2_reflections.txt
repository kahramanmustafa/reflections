What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git file is created. This means git is used for this directory
after this point. All git processes can be done to this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

I think it is something between working directory and repository. It is not committed
yet but is not in the working directory also.
